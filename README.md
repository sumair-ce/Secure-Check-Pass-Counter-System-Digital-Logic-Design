        <h1>Project Description</h1>
        <p>Our project involves utilizing logic gates to create a system. In this system, we are now implementing a 4-bit memory register which will store a 4-bit password. And we will pass that stored password later in our system that will check user entered password and stored password for authentication. There will be four seven segments that will display password entered by user. Our system will verify the entered password by user, and if it is correct, a green light will illuminate. In case of an incorrect password, a red light will turn on. Additionally, the system will indicate the total number of correct passwords through a counter, counting and displaying the attempts made using 2 seven segments display. Moreover, when the counter becomes a multiple of 10, a yellow light will be activated (means for segments displaying 10, 20 etc., buzzer will activate). This will indicate that 10 correct passwords have been entered.</p>
        <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
        <p>The primary objective of our project is to design and implement a secure access control system using logic gates. The specific goals include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Logic Gate Implementation</li>
            <li>Password Establishment/Storage</li>
            <li>User Input Verification</li>
            <li>Visual Indicators</li>
            <li>Entry Attempt Counter</li>
            <li>Threshold Activation</li>
            <li>Security and Reliability</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Project Deliverables</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Proteus Simulation:</strong> A fully functional Proteus simulation showcasing the project's logic gate-based Secure Check Pass Counter system.</li>
            <li><strong>Practical Circuit on Breadboard:</strong> Implementation of the project's circuit on a breadboard for testing and verification.</li>
